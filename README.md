# idleGame
Simple idle game on Unity

## Project's purpose
The purpose of this project is not to make a profitable or AAA game.

It is a simple idle game I'm creating based on a series of guides and my own resources to learn game development and better usage of version control.

## Project's approach
The game is made using Unity 2022.3.22f1 and C#. The objective is making this game playable on Windows and Linux, with a possible android port in the future.

## Project language
While this readme is in English, most of the commits and project will be in Spanish as it's my mother tongue
